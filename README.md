# wfrc-bike-demand-score
Visualizing the bike demand score based on WFRC bike ped demand potential microzone polygons.

The current version of the map is available here: https://joshgroeneveld.github.io/wfrc-bike-demand-score/

I started working on this map by following this tutorial: https://www.helenmakesmaps.com/post/how-to-make-your-first-interactive-map-in-r-gis
The purpose of this project is to learn more of R and Leaflet.
